## Endorse All Button

This is a userscript for LinkedIn that does exactly what it says.

It adds a functional button to the top right corner of the page that will Endorse all Skills for the profile you are currently viewing. 

In order to endorse skills you must already have a connection with that person.

I'm no good with css. So a big ugly green button is all you get, sorry.
